# Sybian/MotorBunny Upgrade Remote

This project's goal is to:
1. Document the control interface for the [MotorBunny](https://motorbunny.com/products/motorbunny) and [Sybian](https://sybian.com/product/the-sybian/)
2. Make an open-source remote control with extra features

## Definitions

* **Operator:** Person operating the remote control of the unit. 
* **Beneficiary:** The person that is riding the MotorBunny/Sybian.
* **Stim:** General term for all the stimulation that could be happening due to the unit, which could include: vibe, insertable rotation, insertable thrusting, e-stim, etc.
* **Insertable:** The toy that is inserted into the beneficiary. 
* **Trim Pot:** Small [potentiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer) that can be used to adjust a setting. Different from a user knob, which is also a potentiometer but is meant to be adjusted during operation. 

## Ideas for extra features

1. **Pause button:** Pause would slow or completely stop any stim.  This would be a momentary button that the operator would press and hold to allow the beneficiary to catch their breath or grab their attention. This would NOT be an e-stop, though a secondary e-stop might be a good idea. This would probably be paired with a small trim pot, to allow the reduction of stim to be either fully-off or a reduced intensity.
2. **Boost button:** A button that would momentarily increase the intensity of all the stim or maybe just vibration.  This would be a momentary button, which might also be additionally limited in software so that the operator can't just mash it and hold it down for long periods.  This would also be paired with a small trim pot to dial in how intense the beneficiary the boost to be.  
    1. It would probably be smart of have some sort of cooldown/re-arm time for this, to allow the beneficiary to settle back in to the average/background stim. 
    2. Adding an "arming" feature.  This would be paired with the Remote Remote Control (below), so that someone not in the scene could arm the Boost and then the operator could trigger it. Another option would be for the Remote Remote Control to immediately trigger the boost. 
3. **Sensors:** Adding a sensor, such as an accelerometer, would be a nice touch to provide an actual visual feedback to the users. Something like an FFT on the accelerometer data would be nice to see, as the beneficiary could affect it by bearing down harder or whatnot. (This is very TBD, based on the machine performance.)
4. **Status/Reporting Chart or graph:** Having some sort of data and status feedback would be nice to see. With so many settings and trim-pots, a display of some variety seems mandatory, and adding visuals like the FFT mentioned above or other "under the hood" details would be great. 
5. **Blinky Lights:** Adding some sort of visual stimulus that pairs with the settings of the machine would make for a better overall experience. 
6. **Remote Remote Control:** (This needs a better name) In party settings, it would be interesting to have a distant remote that displays the status and possible options, like arming or triggering the boost. The idea here is to provide a little bit of audience engagement without crossing the line of interfering with the scene or safety. In spaces that have private rooms, this could be attached to the doorway, so it's obvious that it's meant for observers to use.  Without private rooms, this could be on a mic-stand or small tripod in the vicinity.
